Specifications for the Object Store Module (aka multimedia)

This repository aim to collect and document the different requirements (what the module should do) and the specifications (how the module should do it). The scope is limited to what the module should do to be DINA compliant and should target a specific implementation/institution.

Requirements/Specifications are recorded as [Issues](https://github.com/DINA-Web/object-store-specs/issues).
