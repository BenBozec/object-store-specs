= Object-Store REST API 

== Objects (binary)

FileUpload will use  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2387[multipart] upload where metadata and a file can be sent in the same POST request.

`POST /object`

== Metadata

`GET /metadata`


== Managed Attribute
Managed attributes are key/value pairs where the key can be dynamically created by users with admin privileges. Managed attributes can then be used by regular users
and by filename parsing strategies.

`GET /managed_attributes`


== Filename Parsing


`GET /filename_strategy`

Filename parsing is used to automatically extract managed attributes from a filename and a pre-registered 'strategy'. Strategies are regex based
and can only match a single managed attribute in a filename.

`POST /filename_attributes_extraction`
